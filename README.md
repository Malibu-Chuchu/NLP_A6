## Source Discovery
This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built using LangChain, designed to answer questions about my personal information. The project is based on the 01-rag-langchain.ipynb notebook from the code-along session, modified to complete Task 1: Source Discovery as outlined below. The chatbot leverages a quantized fastchat-t5-3b-v1.0 model for text generation, FAISS for vector storage, and a custom prompt for gentle, informative responses.
#### Documents 
- The goal was to identify and list all relevant sources containing my personal information, such as documents, websites, and personal data, to be ingested into the RAG system.
- My Document: Personal_Info-4.pdf, Description: Core personal information document.
